Here's the new structure:
📁 Project Structure
notes-app/
├── app.js                    # Main application entry point
├── package.json             # Dependencies and scripts
├── config/
│   ├── database.js          # Database configuration
│   └── constants.js         # App constants and environment variables

🏗️ Key Benefits of This Structure
1. Separation of Concerns

Config: Database and environment configuration
Services: Business logic separated from HTTP concerns
Routes: Clean, focused route handlers
Middleware: Reusable authentication logic
Utils: Helper functions and utilities

2. Maintainability

Each file has a single responsibility
Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
Reduced coupling between components

3. Testability

Services can be unit tested independently
Mock dependencies easily
Clear API boundaries

4. Scalability

Easy to add new features
Can extract services to microservices later
Database abstraction allows easy switching

5. Code Reusability

Services can be used across different routes
Middleware can be applied selectively
Utilities are centralized

🚀 Setup Instructions

Create the directory structure:
bashmkdir notes-app
cd notes-app
mkdir config middleware services routes utils data uploads public

Create each file from the modular code above
Install dependencies:
bashnpm init -y
npm install express bcrypt jsonwebtoken knex mysql2 pg
npm install --save-dev nodemon jest

Run the application:
bashnpm start
# or for development
npm run dev


📝 Additional Files Needed
You'll still need to create:

services/categoryService.js - For category management
routes/categories.js - Category routes
routes/admin.js - Admin routes
Error handling middleware
Logging service
Validation middleware

This modular structure makes your application much more professional, maintainable, and scalable! Each module has a clear purpose and can be developed/tested independently.
